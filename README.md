Customizable 3D Game Engine

This project is an ambitious endeavor aimed at creating a powerful and versatile 3D game engine using Java. The engine offers developers a comprehensive toolkit to build immersive gaming experiences, complete with dynamic graphics rendering, responsive user controls, and modular design for easy customization.
Key Features:

🎨 Graphics Rendering: Leveraging Java's Swing library, the engine provides a robust rendering system that brings 3D scenes to life on the screen, boasting vibrant colors and smooth animations.

⌨️ User Interaction: With intuitive keyboard controls, players can navigate through the virtual world seamlessly. The camera movements offer flexible exploration from multiple angles, enhancing immersion.

🌟 Modular Design: The codebase is structured with modularity in mind, allowing developers to extend and customize the engine effortlessly. New game objects can be added, camera behaviors can be modified, and functionalities can be expanded to suit diverse gaming needs.

🌐 Scene Management: The engine includes a flexible scene management system that facilitates the arrangement and manipulation of game objects within the virtual environment. From cubes to spheres, each object can be positioned and configured dynamically.

🚀 High Performance: Operating at a smooth 60 frames per second, the engine ensures optimal performance, crucial for delivering a captivating and seamless gaming experience to players.
